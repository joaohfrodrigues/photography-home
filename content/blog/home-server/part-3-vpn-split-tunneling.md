Part 3: The "Smart" Gateway – VPN Split-Tunneling
Theme: Using the Pi to teleport your TV to another country.

The Goal: Unblocking geo-restricted content (like Netflix US/Hulu) on a Smart TV that doesn't support VPN apps.

The Setup:

Installing WireGuard (or using ProtonVPN CLI).

The "Magic": Policy-Based Routing.

How-To: Configure ip rule so that only the TV's traffic goes through the VPN, while the Pi itself stays on the local high-speed network.

The Result: Your TV thinks it's in New York, but your Pi stays in Portugal.
