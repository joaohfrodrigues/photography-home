I am a Data Engineer based in Lisbon, Portugal, with expertise in building
scalable data pipelines, cloud technologies, and real-time data processing.
I enjoy solving complex problems and delivering impactful solutions.

Beyond my professional life, I am a hobbyist photographer and curious chef.
Photography allows me to capture the world through my lens, while cooking is
where I experiment with flavors and techniques.
